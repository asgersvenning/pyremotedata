Installation

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pyremotedata

Basic Usage
----------

Interactive Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   from pyremotedata.implicit_mount import IOHandler
   
   # This will prompt you for connection details
   handler = IOHandler()
   
   with handler as io:
       files = io.ls()  # List files in remote directory
       print(f"Found {len(files)} files")

Automated Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For non-interactive environments, set environment variables before importing:

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Preferably set these globally, e.g. in .bashrc on Linux
   import os
   os.environ["PYREMOTEDATA_REMOTE_USERNAME"] = "your_username"
   os.environ["PYREMOTEDATA_REMOTE_URI"] = "storage.example.com"
   os.environ["PYREMOTEDATA_REMOTE_DIRECTORY"] = "/your/project/path"
   os.environ["PYREMOTEDATA_AUTO"] = "yes"
   
   from pyremotedata.implicit_mount import IOHandler
   
   handler = IOHandler()
   
   with handler as io:
       files = io.ls()
       print(f"Available files: {files}")

File Operations
--------------

Download a file:

.. code-block:: python

   with IOHandler() as io:
       local_path = io.download("/remote/file.txt", "/local/file.txt")
       print(f"Downloaded to: {local_path}")

Upload a file:

.. code-block:: python

   with IOHandler() as io:
       io.put("/local/file.txt", "/remote/file.txt")
       print("File uploaded successfully")
